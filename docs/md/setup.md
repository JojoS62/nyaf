## Getting Started

Typically, you start like this:

~~~bash
$ npm i @nyaf/lib
~~~

Just start from scratch by a simple setup, which includes:

* A *package.json* and a *tsconfig.json*
* A *src* folder, containing at least:
    * index.html
    * main.ts
    * component.ts

That's it, let the TypeScript compiler create the output and copy static files using `cp`.
